# Project_contrail
Code for analysis of PC constrained high cloud attributes in limited years
I am trying my best to find any possible signal of contrail reduction because of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020
To do so we want to build up strong constrain on meterology field and IWP and AOD in the same time and limit the Cld signal in limited level
